## How to use these APIs.
### 1.You can use the endpoints of APIs I have already deployed on heroku.
You can use the APIs to get Indian banks details. The documentation of API is hosted here.

I am using the free heroku plan and the free mlab plan for mongodb. So I am not sure if it can handle too many requests.
### 2.You can yourself clone and deploy this repo somewhere.
If you yourself deploy this repo somewhere then you can use your instance of deployed APIs endpoints. Documentation is in point 1.
